## About me

I'm a United States Marine lost in the world of code and all of its wonders, my coding journey begins the first time saw a computer back in the early 90's, I was onlyh a chilld then but seeing an object [emoji] showing a list of strings in a arrays running a the "speed of light" was facinating, then being able to stored it in a safe enviroment was the icing on the cake.....
